# DESCRIPTION

This app is for WiFi provisioning over Bluetooth.

# PREREQUISITES

The app uses Network manager to configure the WiFi.

## Install packages

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install network-manager

## Configure dhcpcd to ignore wlan0

To avoid issues with duplicate instances of wpa_supplicant preventing NetworkManager to work properly, we need to modify the default settings. If we kept the setting as is, the wpa_supplicant will be called twice. The first instance will be called by theÂ wpa_supplicant.service, the second one will be executed by dhcpcd deamon. 

To mitigate this issue, first check `/etc/network/interfaces`; this should be empty except for an include from `/etc/network/interfaces.d` (which is in turn empty). This is valid when we have a fresh install of Raspbian.

Then edit `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`, add line:

    denyinterfaces wlan0

This disables execution of the duplicate wpa_supplicant instance.

Then configure Network Manager to control wlan0 and assume dhcp duties. Edit `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`:

    [main]
    plugins=ifupdown,keyfile
    dhcp=internal
    
    [ifupdown]
    managed=true

Finaly, restart the raspberry to take the modifications into effect.

`sudo reboot`

Make sure that there is only one wpa_supplicant instance running after reboot

`ps axu | grep supplicant`
